    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Makes 4 servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Scallion Bunch</li>
        <li>2 cucumbers</li>
        <li>8 oz shredded carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup Jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground beyond beef</li>
        <li>5 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>8 oz teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 TBSP butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: Sour cream, Sesame seeds, Siracha</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and dry all produce.</li>
        <li>In a small pot, combine rice, 2 cups of water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 12-18 minutes. Keep off heat until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, trim and thinly slide scallion, separating whites from greens. Trim ends from cucumber. Using a peeler, shave cucumber lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go, until you get to the seedy core; discard core.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine half the vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt. Toss cucumber ribbons in bowl with vinegar mixture. Set aside, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium high heat. Add carrots and cook, stirring, until just tender, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add beef and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Stir in remaining vinegar. Cook 30 seconds, then stir in teriyaki sauce. Bring to a simmer, then immediately turn off heat. Season again with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Fluff rice with a fork. Stir in 2 TBSP butter and season with salt and pepper; divide between bowls. Arrange beef, carrots, and pickled cucumber on top. (TIP: Drain any excess liquid from cucumber before adding.) Add sour cream, sesame seeds if desired. Garnish with scallion greens and as many remaining sesame seeds as you like.</li>
    </ol>
